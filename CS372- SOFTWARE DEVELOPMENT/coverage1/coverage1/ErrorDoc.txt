**IglooScore1
The first test I found branching out on jacoco was the branch that hadn't been covered. This branch
was determining the least of the two and setting a variable equal to the least value. This if condition
had the "<" switched around which made the greater value as the "least" value. The code also lacked code
that validated whether or not the values were out of bounds ( 0 <= x <= 50).

**IglooScore2
The test that tested the middle one being the least had an error where instead of excluding the 
middle number from the score, it excluded the last one and included the middle one. There was also
an error where if all the values were equal it would equal the top 2 values to 98. I also had some
coverage issues of these conditions. I was able to fix one of them by switching the greater-than-
values.
